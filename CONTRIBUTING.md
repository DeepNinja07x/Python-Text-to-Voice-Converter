# How to Sync the Repo!

## Steps: 
- When you see your repo is behind from the main project's repo in terms of commits. Just sync your repo with the main project's repo.

    > git remote -v

- Add the upstream (main project's) repo's URL

    > git remote add upstream https://github.com/DeepNinja07x/Azure_Telemetry_Service.git

- Now fetch all the new commits from upstream to your local repo.

    > git fetch upstream

- Just check if you are in master branch before merging. If not just change your branch to master branch

    > git checkout master

- Merge the upstream branch with your master branch

    > git merge upstream/master

- push those changes to your GitHub repository

    > git push origin master
